# Video Assets

This directory contains background video files for the Trendloop Visual Pulse website.

## Required Videos (ONLY 1 VIDEO NEEDED)

**You only need ONE background video with these EXACT file names:**

1. **background-hero.mp4** - Main hero section background video
   - Resolution: 1920x1080 or higher
   - Duration: 10-30 seconds (will loop)
   - Format: MP4 (H.264)
   - Size: Keep under 5MB for optimal loading

2. **background-hero.webm** - WebM fallback (optional but recommended)
   - Same video as MP4 but in WebM format
   - Better compression for modern browsers

## Video Guidelines

- Keep videos under 5MB for optimal performance
- Use muted videos to ensure autoplay works across browsers
- Consider providing poster images as fallbacks
- Test on mobile devices for performance

## Placeholder

Until actual videos are added, the components will show gradient backgrounds as fallbacks.

## Usage

Videos are loaded by the `BackgroundVideo` component with automatic fallbacks and performance optimizations.
